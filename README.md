# 🚦 Traffic Violation Detection System using AI/ML

A Machine Learning-based system designed to automatically detect traffic violations from video or image inputs. This project uses Computer Vision techniques to assist in real-time violation alerts for safer and smarter traffic monitoring.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Detects traffic rule violations using AI models.
- 🎥 Supports image/video input from CCTV or uploaded footage.
- 📊 Logs violations with details like timestamp, type, and confidence.
- 📤 Optional feature to alert traffic authorities via a dashboard/API.
- 🧠 Uses OpenCV and Machine Learning/Deep Learning (e.g., YOLO/MediaPipe/CNNs).

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Tools:** 
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (based on your code)
  - MediaPipe (optional)
  - Flask/Streamlit (for UI)
- **IDE:** VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
- **Database:** SQLite / Firebase / CSV (as per your usage)
