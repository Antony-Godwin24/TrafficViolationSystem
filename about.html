    <h1>About Our Project</h1>
    <p>This project is an AI-based system developed to detect common traffic violations such as riding without a helmet and carrying more than two people (overloading) on two-wheelers. Using a deep learning classification model trained with real traffic images, the system can analyze uploaded images or videos and instantly identify whether a violation has occurred. It leverages YOLOv8 for high-speed and accurate predictions, all integrated into a user-friendly web interface built with Flask. The main goal of this project is to promote road safety by automating the detection process, which can assist in real-time monitoring, law enforcement, or awareness campaigns. This solution is lightweight, efficient, and ideal for smart city applications, research purposes, or educational demonstrations.</p>
